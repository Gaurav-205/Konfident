# Konfident Interview 2025

A complete, high-concurrency interview management platform: students browse mentors and book calendar slots with real-time auto-fetch, mentors conduct interviews, track attendance (`Attended` vs `Absent`), and submit evaluations, and administrators oversee the entire lifecycle with live telemetry, rescheduling tools, and CSV exports.

Built with **Node.js 22+, Express 5, EJS, MongoDB (Mongoose), and the Cohere Enterprise Design System**.

---

## 🚀 Setup & Installation Guide

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js 22.5.0 or newer**.
- **npm** (comes bundled with Node.js).
- **MongoDB** — a local `mongod` (`mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`) or a MongoDB Atlas
  cluster. Set the connection string in `MONGODB_URI` (see below). The app data
  and the session store both live in this database.

---

### 2. Quick Setup (Clean Production Setup)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository and enter it
cd konfident

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Copy the environment template and edit it
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Initialize a fresh database with only the root administrator
npm run init

# 5. Start the server
npm start
```

Open **`http://localhost:3000`** in your browser.

#### Initial Administrator Credentials

`npm run init` creates exactly one account: the administrator named by
`ADMIN_EMAIL` in your `.env` (default `admin@yourinstitution.edu`).

- If you set `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, that is the password.
- If you leave it blank, a strong password is **generated and printed once** by
  `npm run init`. Copy it before clearing your terminal — it is not recoverable.

Change it under **My profile → Change password** after your first sign-in.

### 2b. Demo / Development Dataset

```bash
npm run seed     # 5 staff admins, 7 mentors, 40 candidates, a full week of slots
```

Every seeded demo account uses the password `pass123`. **Never run this against
a production database.**

---

### 3. Environment Configuration (`.env`)

`.env.example` documents every supported variable. The ones that matter most:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | HTTP port (default `3000`). |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development`, `production` or `test`. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | **Required in production** — the process exits without it. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 48`. |
| `MONGODB_URI` | MongoDB connection string for both app data and sessions. Defaults to `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/konfident`. Use the `mongodb+srv://…` string for Atlas. |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` / `ADMIN_NAME` | Root administrator created by `npm run init` / `npm run seed`. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Enable Google sign-in and Calendar sync. Leave blank to disable the integration cleanly. |
| `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` | Optional. When unset the callback URL is derived from the request, which is what you want behind Vercel or a custom domain. |

Never commit `.env` — it is git-ignored.

### 4. Password Recovery

There is **no self-service password reset**. A locked-out user contacts an
administrator, who sets a new password directly from `/admin/students/:id` or
`/admin/mentors` (the admin confirms with their own password; the target's other
sessions are dropped). Signed-in users change their own password at
**My profile → Change password**.

## 📖 Complete Platform Operational Workflow

### Step 1: Admin Configuration (`/admin`)
1. Log in with the **Admin** account.
2. Go to **Mentors (`/admin/mentors`)** $\rightarrow$ Click **"Register a new mentor"** $\rightarrow$ Enter their name, email, password, and assign their capabilities (`Technical` and/or `HR`).
3. Go to **Students (`/admin/students`)** $\rightarrow$ Click **"Register a candidate"** $\rightarrow$ Enter their name, email, password, roll number, and branch.
4. Go to **Slots (`/admin/slots`)** $\rightarrow$ Create batches of interview slots for mentors using the duration generator or 1-click presets (*Morning*, *Afternoon*, *Evening*).

---

### Step 2: Student Booking & Live Auto-Fetch (`/student`)
1. Candidates log in at `/login` using their credentials or 1-click **Google Sign-In**.
2. Visit **Mentors Directory (`/student/mentors`)** to browse verified evaluators and open capacities.
3. Visit **Book Slots (`/student/slots`)**:
   - The platform **auto-fetches** live open slots in real-time.
   - Click **"Quick Book Earliest Slot"** or pick a specific time slot.
   - Candidates book **1 Technical Interview** and **1 HR Interview**.

---

### Step 3: Mentor Conducting, Attendance & Scoring (`/mentor`)
1. Mentors log in to their dashboard (`/mentor`) to view assigned candidates and session timings.
2. Open the interview session (`/mentor/interview/:id`) $\rightarrow$ Click **"Open resume"** to review the student's CV.
3. Track Meeting Attendance:
   - Click **"✓ Mark Attended (Present)"**: Confirms presence and unlocks the rubric evaluation form.
   - Click **"✗ Mark Absent / No-Show"**: Records missed sessions and protects against unauthorized grading.
4. Fill in category marks according to the official criteria:
   - **Technical Interview (30 Marks)**: Resume Readiness (10), Project Defence (10), DSA (10).
   - **HR Interview (20 Marks)**: Behavioural Skills (10), HR Performance (10).
5. Enter qualitative feedback and submit.

---

### Step 4: Performance Results & Export
- **Students (`/student/results`)**: View grand total score (/50), category marks breakdown, grade, mentor qualitative feedback, and click **"🖨️ Print scorecard / Save PDF"**.
- **Admin Reports (`/admin/reports`)**: View cohort averages, attendance telemetry, and download a 1-click **CSV Data Export (`/admin/reports.csv`)**.

## 🧪 Automated Test Suite

```bash
npm test
```

Requires a reachable `MONGODB_URI` (local `mongod` or Atlas). The mongo-backed
suites upsert their own fixtures (non-destructive) so they run safely against an
existing database.

The suite boots the real server in-process and drives it over HTTP exactly as a
browser would — cookies, form posts, redirects — then asserts against the
database. It covers helper units, every page render, the Mongoose models and
aggregation queries, security headers and CSRF, all three role guards, booking
concurrency, the evaluation rubric, and the full auth lifecycle (password login,
admin and self-service password change, logout guards).

```text
helpers  11 · views 19 · models 5 · queries 4 · e2e 35 · auth 33  —  107 assertions, 0 failed
```

## 🛠️ Commands Reference

## 🗄️ Data Layer Notes

- **MongoDB via Mongoose.** Models live in `src/models/`, the connection in
  `src/db.js`. Indexes are declared on the schemas and built on connect
  (`autoIndex: true`). No migration step — collections and indexes are created
  on first use.
- **Sessions are stored in the same MongoDB** (`connect-mongo`), so they survive
  restarts and are shared across cluster workers / serverless instances. A
  signed `konfident_auth` cookie is the stateless backstop and is re-validated
  against the users collection on every request.
- **All interview times are stored as wall-clock IST** (slot dates as
  `YYYY-MM-DD` strings, times as `HH:MM`). Every "is this slot in the past"
  comparison goes through `src/helpers.js` (`nowMinute()`, `today()`,
  `isPast()`), so the application behaves identically on a UTC server and an
  IST one.
- **Seeders** (`src/seed.js`): `--clean` (root admin only), `--dev` (demo
  cohort + a week of slots), `--test` (deterministic cohort for `npm test`),
  `--empty` (drop everything). The seeder refuses to run against a non-local
  `MONGODB_URI` unless `SEED_ALLOW_REMOTE=1` is set.
